<p style="font-size:15.5px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:10px;padding:2px;font-style:italic;"> MS Dhoni has bid adieu to international cricket more than a year since his last assignment in the 2019 World Cup. The wicketkeeper-batsman from Jharkhand enjoyed a remarkable career both behind the wickets and in front and leaves the game as one of the best to ever grace the game, especially in the 50-overs format where he left an indelible legacy both as a player and as a captain.

His career highlights include winning World T20 in 2007, World Cup in 2011, Champions Trophy in 2013 and captaining India when they were the number one ranked side in Test cricket. On a personal capacity, he has won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award multiple times as well as was adjudicated the Man of the Match in the final of the 2011 World Cup. He is India's second most capped player across formats with 535 appearances and is the third most successful wicketkeeper in terms of dismissals (829) behind Mark Boucher and Adam Gilchrist. He stepped down from the Test team during India's tour of Australia in 2014/15.<p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:10px;padding:2px;font-style:italic;"> MS Dhoni is undoubtedly India's best wicket keeper and one of the finest in the world as well. His stumping skills are now part of Indian cricketing folklore. Here is this special compilation I have dug out 15 awesome stumping by MSD for all you Dhoni fans out there.MS Dhoni's lightning quick work behind the stumps got him two more stumpings in the second T20 between India and Sri Lanka, which India won by 88 runs, at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on Friday.
Wicket keepers are like guardians in the middle who gets involved in every moment of the game. Right from the beginning, the wicket-keeping techniques and the roles of the men who kept the wickets have kept on evolving.

Traditionally, wicket-keepers were chosen in international Test sides primarily because of their wicket-keeping abilities. Wicket-keeping is regarded as the most strenuous fielding position, due not only to its physical demands but also its mental and psychological ones. Teams would therefore choose wicket-keepers based on their wicket-keeping skill.
